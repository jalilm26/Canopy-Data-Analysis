Canopy is one such boutique streaming service that plans to cater to the viewers of French-language movies. Their initial business goals, as a streaming service provider, are to:

offer curated selections of best-rated French-language movies from the existing content
make French-language movies available to various age groups
identify the least tapped genres so as to provide the filmmakers with data to make original content for Canopy.

Tasks:

load or import the data sets
combine both the data sets
handle the missing data and clean it
find the top 20 movies in each genre that is available in the French language
analyse the genre distribution in French-language movies.
